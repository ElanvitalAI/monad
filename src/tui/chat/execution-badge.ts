// ── TUI TRUE-execution badge (self-cognition §1) ──────────────────────
//
// Resolves the compact engine/model badge for the dashboard chat
// completion line — `✔ Streaming (19s · ↓ 200 tokens · 🧠 terra(high))`.
// The value is the model that ACTUALLY ran this turn (from the route
// decision recorded in the ACP bridge's getActiveModel), not the config
// original — so the "config=opus but codex/terra ran" illusion is
// visible at a glance (#3 badge · #4 opus-respect surfaced, not silenced).
//
// TUI-surface presentation leaf — home = src/tui/chat/ (RFC §6b · M2).
// Moved out of dashboard/ (표면-중립 분해): the badge is pure TUI chat
// completion-line presentation. dashboard/execution-badge.ts is now a
// re-export shim for backward compat until callers migrate.
