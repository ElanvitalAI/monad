// ── ToolSearch spec (pure · zero-dependency) ──
//
// The ToolSearch **schema** is needed by two very different layers:
//
//   - the dispatch layer (`tool-search.ts`), which resolves deferred
//     schemas out of the runtime registry / surface spec pool, and
//   - the **prompt** layer (`session-runtime/tier-flip.ts`), which must
//     hand the model a summoner whenever it defers anything.
//
// tier-flip is a lean prompt-assembly seam; pulling in `tool-search.ts`
// would drag the tool-runtime registry (and with it the verifier /
// guardian / intent-miss chain) into that path. So the spec — which is
// a pure literal — lives here and both layers import it. One source of
// truth, no cycle.

 * ⭐ Hydration hand-off key (F2 gap④ · 2026-07-26).
 *
 * A tool dispatcher that *resolves new tool schemas* (ToolSearch) attaches the
 * resolved `LLMToolSpec[]` to its result under this key. The tool loop
 * (`streamLLMWithTools`) lifts them into the **provider tool list for the
 * remaining turns**, then strips the key before the result is rendered into
 * the conversation.
 *
 * Why it must exist: returning a `<functions>{…}</functions>` block as *text*
 * does NOT make a tool callable. Providers only accept calls for functions in
 * the declared `tools=[…]` array, and that array was fixed for the whole loop
 * — so the model summoned a schema, found it still uncallable, re-summoned,
 * and gave up (실측 5회·하니스 2종). Text-only hydration is a dead end.
 *
 * Generic on purpose: any dispatcher can grow the tool surface this way; the
 * loop knows nothing about ToolSearch. Stripped before rendering so the
 * schemas are not paid for twice in context.
