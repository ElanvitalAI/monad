// ── ToolRuntime — the shared dispatch contract ──
//
// Phase S4 of the PTY promotion track (DESIGN-pty-llm-native-promotion.md
// §3B). Mirrors codex-rs's `ToolRuntime<Req, Out>` trait: one shape
// that every LLM-callable tool implements, exposing a single
// dispatchToolByName() entry point callable from skill-runner,
// dashboard chat loop, plugin host, and — eventually — MCP export.
//
// Scope is deliberately minimal in this phase:
//   • types + registry exist
//   • PtyShell* are the first migrated clients (proof)
//   • skill-runner and dashboard STILL own their direct-dispatch
//     maps for every other tool; migration is tool-by-tool in
//     follow-up commits
//
// The migration criterion is reuse: any tool whose dispatch logic
// differs between skill and dashboard scopes (e.g. approval gates,
// capability policy, audit logging) is a good candidate. Tools
// with identical skill/dashboard behavior can stay on the direct
// map until there's an actual reason to change.
