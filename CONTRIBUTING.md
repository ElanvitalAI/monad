# Contributing to elanous

Thank you for helping.

## How to contribute

1. **Bugs and small fixes** — open a pull request. Include a failing test or the command
   that reproduces the problem.
2. **New features or architecture changes** — open an issue first. Planning happens in
   issues, not in files committed to the repository.
3. **Questions** — open a discussion.

## Development setup

```bash
bun install
bun bin/elanous.mjs doctor      # what is configured, what is missing
bun test <path>               # tests for the files you changed
bun run scripts/ci-typecheck-changed.ts
```

See `AGENTS.md` for the working agreement that both humans and coding agents follow.
